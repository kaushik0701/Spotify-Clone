Hi Satyajit, 
Update.. 
We have been analyzing the code for the existing upload functionality available in the CEMS screen. Now, we can start working on the IVR-related table that we need to create for online upload. 

The upload functionality is implemented using Spring Batch,and  we are new to it, so we started learning from the documentation provided by Farzeen.
